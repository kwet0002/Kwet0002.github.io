My webportofilio project is absed on the services I provide everything i learned through my first two semsters. I built this project using Bootsrap and a little bit of css. The challenges I facend through this project was sizing the backgound image and making slightly smaller to look more appealing , another challenge I faced was sizing the cards to all look the same size.
Building this project i learned How to properly style my pages and finding a way to use the class ID to my adavantage. I was also able to learn to use all benefit that bootrstrap comes with , for example putting my content into a container making it well responsive to all devices .
Most of my coding was provide through bootstrap shortcuts. The only Code or class that ws not mine was Data target which i used to target my navigation to certain sections of the site. I used this so that I could have all my content in one page with the same layout, rather than creating multiple pages.
